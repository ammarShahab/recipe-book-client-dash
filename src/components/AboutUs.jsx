            Welcome to Dish Diary: Your Culinary Companion
          </h2>
          <p className="dark:text-gray-200">
            In a world where food transcends borders, tells stories, and brings
            people together, Dish Diary is your trusted platform to capture,
            create, and celebrate the joy of cooking. Built for food lovers,
            passionate home chefs, and anyone who loves experimenting in the
            kitchen, Dish Diary is more than a recipe app ‚Äî it‚Äôs a digital
            culinary journal tailored just for you.
          </p>
          <p className="dark:text-gray-200">
            At Dish Diary, we believe every meal has a memory, and every recipe
            is worth preserving. Our mission is simple: to empower users to
            curate their personal culinary collections, discover dishes from
            around the world, and connect with the food community through

            The Inspiration Behind Dish Diary
          </h2>
          <p>
            The idea for Dish Diary was born from a simple frustration:
            organizing personal recipes in a way that‚Äôs meaningful, accessible,
            and inspiring. Traditional notebooks get lost. Random screenshots
            clutter phones. Bookmark folders go forgotten. There had to be a
            better way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dish Diary was designed to solve that. We wanted to offer a seamless
            digital experience where you could:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Save your tried-and-true recipes</li>
            <li>Record special cooking instructions</li>
            <li>Track your favorite dishes</li>
            <li>Discover global cuisines</li>
            <li>Share meals with fellow foodies</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And so, Dish Diary became the solution ‚Äî a place where your kitchen
            creativity has no limits.
